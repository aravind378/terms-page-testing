                    <li style="font-weight: 600;">Terms and Conditions – Children’s Daycare <br>By enrolling your child at our daycare facility, you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions:</li>
                    <li>1. Enrollment & Documentation: All required enrollment forms, including medical records, emergency contact information, and signed consents, must be submitted and approved prior to your child’s first day. Any changes in information must be updated promptly.</li>
                    <li>2. Hours of Operation: The daycare operates from [Insert Time] to [Insert Time], Monday through Friday. Children must be picked up promptly. Late pickups will incur additional charges as per the center’s late fee policy.</li>
                    <li>3. Fees & Payment: Fees are due in advance on a [weekly/monthly] basis. A late payment fee will apply for overdue accounts. Continued non-payment may result in suspension or termination of services.</li>
                    <li>4. Health & Safety: For the safety of all children, any child displaying signs of illness (e.g., fever, vomiting, contagious conditions) must remain at home. The daycare reserves the right to refuse entry to a sick child and may require a doctor’s clearance before the child can return.</li>
                    <li>5. Medication & Allergies: Medication will only be administered with written parental consent and proper labeling. Parents must inform the daycare of any allergies or medical conditions. Emergency action plans must be submitted for severe allergies.</li>
                    <li>6. Behavior & Discipline: Positive guidance techniques are used to promote good behavior. If a child consistently displays harmful or disruptive behavior, a meeting with the parent(s) will be required. Repeated or severe incidents may result in dismissal from the program.</li>
                    <li>7. Food & Meals: Parents must provide meals/snacks unless otherwise arranged. We are a nut-free facility and ask that all food brought in complies with our allergy policies. Staff must be informed of any dietary restrictions.</li>
                    <li>8. Personal Belongings: All personal items must be clearly labeled. The daycare is not responsible for lost or damaged belongings. Children should not bring toys from home unless approved for special events.</li>
                    <li>9. Emergency Procedures: In the event of an emergency, staff will take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of children and will contact parents as soon as possible. If medical attention is needed, the child may be taken to the nearest medical facility.</li>
                    <li>10. Photo & Media Consent: With parental permission, photos and videos may be taken for educational or promotional purposes. Consent may be revoked at any time in writing.</li>
                    <li>11. Termination of Services: Either party may terminate enrollment with [Insert Notice Period, e.g., 2 weeks] written notice. The daycare reserves the right to terminate enrollment immediately in cases involving safety, unpaid fees, or policy violations.</li>
                    <li>12. Attendance and Absences: Regular attendance is important for the child’s routine and social development. Please notify the daycare in advance if your child will be absent. No refunds or discounts are provided for missed days due to illness, vacation, or personal reasons.</li>
                    <li>13. Drop-Off and Pick-Up Authorization: Only individuals listed on the authorized pickup list will be allowed to collect your child. A government-issued photo ID may be required. Temporary permissions must be submitted in writing.</li>
                    <li>14. Transition Period: We understand that children need time to adjust to new environments. A transition period of shorter stays may be recommended during the first few days of attendance, depending on the child’s comfort level.</li>
                    <li>15. Inclement Weather & Emergency Closures: The daycare may close due to severe weather, natural disasters, or public health emergencies. Parents will be notified via [text/email/phone]. No compensation is provided for closures beyond our control.</li>
